- [x] Educational Content Library - Age-appropriate safety resources
- [x] Logging & Audit System - Tracks decisions and actions for transparency

## Implementation Progress
‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Full AI Agent System Implementation

### What's Been Built:

#### 1. Core Models (`src/models/`)
- [x] `message.py` - SuspiciousMessage, ChildProfile, MessageMetadata with threat types and severity levels
- [x] `actions.py` - ActionDecision, ActionPlan, CommunicationContent for decision tracking

#### 2. Decision Engine (`src/decision_engine/`)
- [x] `decision_engine.py` - Comprehensive decision-making logic with risk assessment
- [x] Multi-factor risk scoring (severity, threat type, age, history)
- [x] Age-appropriate response determination
- [x] Escalation criteria and follow-up planning

#### 3. Communication System (`src/communication/`)
- [x] `message_generator.py` - Age-appropriate message generation for all stakeholders
- [x] Template-based communication system
- [x] Tone and content adaptation based on recipient and situation

#### 4. AI Agent (`src/agents/`)
- [x] `ai_agent.py` - Main AIAgent class and AgentManager
- [x] Complete message processing pipeline
- [x] Action plan creation and timeline management
- [x] Batch processing capabilities

#### 5. Utilities (`src/utils/`)
- [x] `logger.py` - Comprehensive logging and audit trail system
- [x] Structured logging for decisions, communications, and actions

#### 6. Configuration (`config/`)
- [x] `agent_config.json` - System configuration with thresholds and settings
- [x] `educational_content.json` - Age-appropriate safety tips and resources

#### 7. Sample Data (`data/`)
- [x] `sample_messages.json` - Realistic test scenarios covering all threat types

#### 8. Examples (`examples/`)
- [x] `basic_usage.py` - Comprehensive demonstration of system capabilities
- [x] Multiple demo scenarios (basic processing, batch processing, different threats)

#### 9. Testing (`tests/`)
- [x] `test_decision_engine.py` - Unit tests for decision-making logic
- [x] `test_ai_agent.py` - Unit tests for main agent functionality
- [x] Coverage of core functionality and edge cases

#### 10. Documentation
- [x] `README.md` - Comprehensive documentation with usage examples
- [x] `requirements.txt` - All necessary dependencies

### Key Features Implemented:

‚úÖ **Multi-Threat Support**: Handles bullying, harassment, sexual content, manipulation, scams, etc.
‚úÖ **Age-Appropriate Responses**: Tailored communication for different age groups
‚úÖ **Risk Assessment**: Multi-factor scoring system for intelligent decision-making
‚úÖ **Stakeholder Communication**: Separate messaging for parents, children, and senders
‚úÖ **Action Prioritization**: Immediate, high, medium, low priority action scheduling
‚úÖ **Audit Trail**: Complete logging of all decisions and actions
‚úÖ **Batch Processing**: Efficient handling of multiple messages
‚úÖ **Educational Resources**: Age-appropriate safety content and crisis resources
‚úÖ **Escalation Logic**: Automatic escalation to authorities when needed
‚úÖ **Follow-up Planning**: Scheduled monitoring and check-ins

### System Capabilities:

üéØ **Decision-Making**: Intelligent analysis of threat context and severity
üí¨ **Communication**: Age-appropriate, supportive messaging for all parties
üìö **Education**: Tailored safety resources and guidance
üîç **Monitoring**: Comprehensive audit trails and decision tracking
‚ö° **Scalability**: Batch processing and agent management
